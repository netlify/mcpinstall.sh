## MCPInstall.sh


### Needs
[] Support for env/headers placeholders so that the user can be prompted to input the value to get a completed view of the input.
[] Add option for fallback suggestions for stdio tools like mcp-proxy where http is not directly supported (e.g. codex)
[] CLI support for windows
[] Ways to validate ownership - having a list of hosted config shas or simply reflecting the mcpconfig shared on their site.
    - this might be _the_ way to have short links. mcpinstall.sh/netlify.com/mcp
  - the registry is pretty wild set up. Perhaps a .wellknown/mcpinstall.json which covers the basics  

  - support store listing links


  - Update setup to allow for multiple options for setup


- long URL for manually configured work
- short url for hosted configuration mcpinstall.sh/mcp.stripe.com
- verified links for hosted configuration or key
- impossible for someone to squat on
- support registry format in the future


[] support validations from github repos similar to domains?
[] generate markdown for github
[] links that support one-click installations
